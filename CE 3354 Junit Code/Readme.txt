For this project, I used eclipse and my JRE was [J2SE-1.8] and I used JUnit5.

To run this, either load the entire project "CE 3354 Junit Code" into eclipse and then run the Junit or compile the three classes: DatabaseTest.java, User.java, and UserDatabase.java  and then run the DatabaseTest.java class as a Junit.
